# config_diff_export
This Drupal 8 module has a very narrow scope: you can export a configuration diff (current config against config sync directory) as a packed archive.
## Caveats
Always keep in mind that only added/changed configuration can be exported as files! Of course deletions cannot be part of the archive ðŸ˜‰
